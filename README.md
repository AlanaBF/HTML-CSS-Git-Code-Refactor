# HTML CSS Git Code Refactor
Refactoring existing code to make the web page more accessible.

## Description

-  To improve the accessibility of the web page without changing what it does:
-  Semantic HTML elements can now be found throughout the source code
-  HTML elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
-  Image and icon elements contain accessible `alt` attributes
-  Heading attributes fall in sequential order
-  Title elements contain a concise, descriptive title
-  The site is now optimized for search engines
-  I  found, tested and fixed a broken link, I added comments throughout for future developers to show what has been done, I simplified the code to make it cleaner and easier to read. I added semantic code throughout and removed div elements.
